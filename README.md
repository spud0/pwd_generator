# Password Generator 
A Password Generator written in Python. 

## How it Works: 
Linux distributions come with a file that contains A LOT of english words. By selecting a random word from all the words and then doing that a few times, I can generate a pseudo-random password.

The file is located at '/usr/share/dict/words'. 

## Why? The Inspiration: 
I read an article [here.] (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/the-logic-behind-three-random-words)

## TODO: 
- Add GUI using GTK
- Finish working on the word cleaning 
- Make a cache for the passwords
