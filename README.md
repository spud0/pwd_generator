# Password Generator 
A Password Generator written in Python. 

## How it Works: 
Linux distributions come with a file that contains A LOT of english words. By selecting a random word from all the words and then doing that a few times, I can generate a pseudo-random password.

The file is located at '/usr/share/dict/words'. 

## Why? The Inspiration: 
I read an article [here.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/the-logic-behind-three-random-words) This article basically detailed the idea that 3 random words for a password is the ideal length and provides optimal security. 

## TODO: 
- Link GUI with passwd.py file 
- Fix the main.py file
- Finish working on the word cleaning 
- Make a cache for the passwords

## Links: 
Here are the links to the documentation of the modules that I used in this project.
